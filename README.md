# React Media Player Website

## Description
This project is a web application built with React, integrating a media player, a track selection menu, dropdown menus, and a YouTube player. This interface was used at the **MusÃ©e du Bas-Saint-Laurent** as part of the exhibition **Corolles Radiantes**. Designed for tablets and mobile phones, it allows museum visitors to listen to the musical work of **CoppÃ©lia Laroche-Francoeur**, which is a **sonification of sound**.

This musical project explores the transposition of visual and sensory perceptions through coding and music. Based on **Sarah SeenÃ©**â€™s photographs, which capture female bodies marked by physical differences, a **Python** algorithm extracts visual data and transforms it into sound material. The goal is to extend the visual experience of the photographs by giving them a sonic dimension. Rather than a simple audio description, this project offers an immersive experience where code becomes a bridge between visual and auditory perception.

Each photographic arrangement corresponds to a one-minute sound sequence. In the first arrangement, the notes heard are directly derived from the image data, establishing a tangible relationship between the visual and auditory elements. Rather than associating each pixel with a note, this project translates the exploration of gazeâ€”what captures attention, intrigues, or unsettles. The intention is to convey the tensions and nuances perceived when the gaze lingers on an image.

The algorithm, based on **OpenCV** and **Scikit-learn**, analyzes contrasts, colors, and light, then segments the image into clusters that reveal its dominant patterns. MIDI files are automatically generated after analyzing each image.

## Features
- **YouTube Player**: Integration of a YouTube video via `YoutubePlayerBlock`.
- **Sound Bar**: Displays and controls audio tracks with `SoundBarBlock`.
- **Music Selection Menu**: Allows users to choose and navigate through different tracks using `MusicMenuBlock`.
- **Dropdown Menus**: Dynamic selection of tracks and related content.
- **Language Switching**: Option to switch between French and English with `LangageSwitcherBlock`.
- **State Management with React Hooks**: Uses `useState` and `useEffect` to store the selected language and track.

## Technologies Used
- **React.js** (Vite or Create React App)
- **CSS** (custom styling for the user interface)
- **LocalStorage** (to store the selected language)
- **YouTube Embedded API** (via `YoutubePlayerBlock`)
- **JSON** (for storing music menu information)
- **Python (OpenCV, Scikit-learn)** for image analysis and MIDI file generation

## Installation
 **Install dependencies**
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
 **Start the development server**
   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000/`.
